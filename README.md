- 👋 Hi, I’m @KevinVanstone - a Full-stack web developer with experience in HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React, Node.JS, Express, and a number of related technologies.

- 👀 I’m interested in Web3, the capital markets, and the world of cryptocurrency, with over a decade of experience working on front-end projects including blogs,
personal websites, and retail platforms.

- 🌱 After graduating from the Brainstation Web Development Bootcamp in January of 2022, I am now working on my own personal project, Open Seer, a blockchain
explorer that allows users to search for, collect, and view any NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. 

- 💞️ I am currently open to new work opportunities in web development, including Full-Stack, Front-End, and Back-end roles.
